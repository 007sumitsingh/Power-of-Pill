Question:
We need to directly establish a model to measure the impact of state laws regarding birth control access for minors on the likelihood of getting married before age 23, for college-educated women born in the United States from 1935 to 1957.

Methods: 
We have the 1% sample of the IPUMS dataset for the analysis. We further filtered it for the women who were born in from 1935 to 1957. 
We fit a regression model with the dependent variable as “whether or not a particular woman was married at the age of 23” ( 1 for “yes” and 0 for “no”) 

In this econometric quantitative model we will estimate the coefficients of the independent variables which are likely to make an effect on the outcome. 
We will analyse the results carefully and see whether there is a relation or not. 

Dataset:
We have the 1% sample of the IPUMS dataset for the analysis. We further filtered it for the women who were born in from 1935 to 1957. We also have the datset of US laws of every state regarding the age legal age of taking the contraceptive pills and legal abortion laws. 

Variables in the dataset:

1. SEX: We use this variable to subset the sample to have only females. 
2. BIRTHYR: Year of birth, all age calculations will require this variable, in addition we need to subset the sample to women born between 1935 to 1957. 
3. AGEMARR: Age at first marriage. We need this to create our dependent variable. 
4. RACE: Race of individual, we need it to make race dummies. 
5. BPL: State of birth. Used for fixed effects. Also used to constrain sample to only US women. 
6. EDUC: Educational attainment. We only keep those coded as having four years of college or more. 
 The laws dataset has following two variables of interest for us, it provies us the with the information of legal ages to access to oral contraceptives in each state.
1. STATEFIP: State identifier, coded the same way as BPL in IPUMS. 
2. GKYearConsent16: Year in which a state made contraceptives available to minors. 
3. Abortion: Year of legalized abortion per state. 

Data Manipulation 
1.  We merged the 2 datsets by their state coded to access the rules regarding the restricitions of pill and abortion. 
2.  We created dummy variable AGEMARR23 which is equal to 1 if a woman has married before the age of 23 otherwise 0.
3.  We created a dummy variable PillDummy which is equal to 1 if the woman's state of birth had a nonrestrictive birth control law for minors at the time she was 18 years old otherwise 0.
4.  race: Dummy variable with value 1 if the individual is African American otheriwise 0.
5.  AbortionDummy : Dummy variable which is equal to 1 if the abortion was legal in the state when the person was 18.
6.  After that we created dummy variables for birth state and year of birth.







Results 
For the 1st model we considered that only the independent variables – PillDummy, Race, state of birth and year of birth. Which gives us the following regression equation 
AGEMarr23 = β0 + β1PillDummy + β2race + δStatemat + γYearmat

For the 2nd model we considered that the independepent variables are – PillDummy, Race, state of birth, year of birth and AbortionDummy . Which gives us the following regression equation

Interpretation of results

The estimates in 1st model indicate that the adoption of a nonrestrictive birth control law for minors was associated with a modest (but statistically significant(not so much) p value= 0.054) two percentage-point decline in the probability that a college graduate
women was married before age 23. The estimates in 2nd model show
roughly similar effects of both access to birth control and legalization
of abortion. 

While this precludes reaching a conclusion regarding the degree to which the pill and abortion were complements or substitutes, the negative point estimates suggest that they are complements. One interpretation of this result is that women regarded abortion as back-up for the pill rather than as a substitute.
